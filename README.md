## My Introduction to Programming, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision

My journey into programming and computer vision began thanks to Professor Watta, whose instruction and encouragement inspired me to pursue these fields. For my final project, I implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in C++ for a crude face recognition system. While my initial implementation was not mathematically perfect, this project marked the beginning of my trajectory in machine learning and computer vision.

## Principal Component Analysis Final Project: Face Recognition

Using C++, I attempted to apply PCA for basic face recognition. The process involved extracting principal components from a set of facial images and projecting new faces onto this basis for identification. Although my implementation had flaws, it was a formative experience that sparked my interest in the intersection of programming and AI.
